# Tweet-Toot
Tweet-Toot is a small Python3 project to convert a tweet to a toot. It's basically a Twitter relay for Mastodon.

The way it works is this: add Tweet-Toot as a cron job, and it will repost new tweets to any Mastodon account you configure. Just clone this repo, configure the script, add it to a cron job, and it will get cracking.

## How do I install this?
Getting Tweet-Toot working is pretty easy. Before you can install it, you're going to need to do the following:

- Pick a Mastodon instance of your choice. You'll need this instance's URL.
- Create an app on this Mastodon instance and generate an access token.
- Get the Twitter URL of the account you want to watch.

Once you have the above, just follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the Python3 libraries: `python3 -m venv venv`, then `source venv/bin/activate` and install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. In `config.json`, update the following:

- `tweets.source_account_url`: The source Twitter account.
- `toots.host_instance`: The HTTPS URL of your instance.
- `toots.app_secure_token`: The Mastodon app access token.

For example:

- `tweets.source_account_url` = https://twitter.com/SarcasmMother
- `toots.host_instance` = https://botsin.space
- `toots.app_secure_token` = XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX'


## How do I run it?
Once it's all setup, just run the main file like this:

Activate the virtualenv you created on install (if it's not activated yet): `source venv/bin/activate` and run the script:

`python3 run.py`

If all goes well, you'll see something like this:
```bash

## Tutorial
The tutorial for this code can be found here: [Tweet-Toot: Building a bot for Mastodon using Python](https://notes.ayushsharma.in/2018/09/tweet-toot-building-a-bot-for-mastodon-using-python).

## Running with Docker
I've added a `Dockerfile` with this repo so you can get up and running quickly.

1. Update the `config.json` with the Twitter account you want to relay.
2. Leave the `toots.app_secure_token` blank.
3. Build your container with the command below:


```bash
docker build --build-arg mastodon_token=<Mastodon_Token> --build-arg papertrail_token=<Papertrail_Token> -t <DockerHub_Repo>:<Repo_Tag> .
```

The container has support for sending logs to Papertrail. Just add your authentication token. You can get it from your Papertrail client installation command.


## Things to remember
- The script is designed to toot once per invokation. I recommend timing your cron jobs according to the post frequency that you need instead of modifying the code.
- Mastodon instance admins are people too. Don't toot-blast your instance and make life harder for them.
- When configuring your bot, ensure you clearly display an account where you can be reached in case of issues.

Have fun :)
